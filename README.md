# Bitcoin Block Miner

This project simulates the process of mining a Bitcoin block.

It includes:

- Reading transactions from a mempool
- Building a valid block
- Mining the block by solving the proof-of-work puzzle
- Writing the result to `out.txt`

This was developed as part of a Bitcoin protocol learning challenge.
